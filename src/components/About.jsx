            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Also known as I'm Tchano-py and my love for the IT business started when I was 14 years old, even though I didn't really know what programming really is. That's because before I just wanted to learn how to fix PCs, phones and other equipment.</p>
            <p>After starting my high school I had more and more love for IT, then during my study I had to deal with my choice, or where I would specialize, I had to deal with three options, among them programming, Computer Networks and Electronics.</p>
            <p>And finally choose the branch of programming, despite the difficulties I had during my learning I didn't give up, I continued and until today I try to improve my skills. I am happy to have Programming in my life. If you want to get into this business, the advice I have for you is that it won't be easy, but with your determination and focus you will succeed.</p>
